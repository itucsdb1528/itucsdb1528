      Fig. 1: ER diagram of tables implemented by me.

I have implemented 5 tables in this project, they are explained one by one bellow.

Table 1 (Diet Table):
*********************

.. code-block:: plpgsql

    CREATE TABLE DIETT
	(
		DID   INT  NOT NULL ,
		DNAME VARCHAR (30)  ,
		DAGE  INT           ,
		DIETFROM  CHAR (25) ,
		DIETSTART  VARCHAR (30),       
		PRIMARY KEY (DID)
        )

This table is to store information about diets used in fitness.

*DID* 		Diet Id
*DNAME* 	Diet Name 
*DAGE* 		Diet Age
*DIETFROM* 	Diet From
*DIETSTART* 	Diet Start Age

*DID* Diet Id is the primary key for this table.



Table 2 (Fitness Types):
************************

.. code-block:: plpgsql

    CREATE TABLE FITNESSTYPES
        (
		FTID   			INT   NOT NULL,
		RECOMMENDED_DIET 	INT,
		FTNAME 			VARCHAR (30),
		FTAGE  			INT,
		FTFEES   		DECIMAL (18, 2),
		PRIMARY KEY 		(FTID),       
		FOREIGN KEY (RECOMMENDED_DIET) REFERENCES DIETT (DID)
        )

This table stores information about Types of the fitness. It also keeps records of type of diets required for each type of fitness.

*FTID* 			Fitness Type Id
*RECOMMENDED_DIET* 	Fitness Type Diet 
*FTNAME* 		Fitness Type Name
*FTAGE* 		Fitness Type Age requirements at which age it should be started
*FTFEES* 		Fitness Type Fees if fitnessers are joing at a private club

*FTID* Fitness Type Id is the primary key for this table.
*RECOMMENDED_DIET * Refrences the Diet Id of Diets table.


Table 3 (Fitness Records Worldwide):
************************************

.. code-block:: plpgsql

        CREATE TABLE FITNESSRECORDS
        (
		RCID   	INT NOT NULL	,
		WNAME 	VARCHAR (30)  	,
		RKG 	VARCHAR (50)  	,
		PRIMARY KEY (RCID)
        )

This table stores information about Fitness Records that fitnessers won worldwide, it is important to mention the KG of weight that the fitnessers won the record in.

*RCID* 			Fitness Record Id 
*WNAME* 		Fitness Record Holder Name
*RKG* 			Fitness Record Kg that fitnessers won record in

*RCID* Fitness Record Id is the primary key for this table.


Table 4 (ntc_tag_rel):
**********************

.. code-block:: plpgsql

        CREATE TABLE FITNESSMD
        (
		MDID   	INT NOT NULL,
		MDNAME 	VARCHAR (30),
		PRIMARY KEY (MDID)
        )

This table stores information about medicines some fitnessers use during the fitness, some could be usefull where some could not be healty, so here we will try to list the healthy ones.

*MDID* 			Medicine Id
*MDNAME* 		Medicine Name which is famous in todays market

*MDID* Fitness Medicine Id is the primary key for this table.


Table 5 (ntc_tag_rel):
**********************

.. code-block:: plpgsql

        CREATE TABLE FAMFITNESSERS
        (
		FAMID   	INT NOT NULL,
		FNAME 		VARCHAR (30)   ,
		RECORDNO 	INT,
		PRIMARY KEY 	(FAMID), 
		FOREIGN KEY 	(RECORDNO) REFERENCES FITNESSRECORDS(RCID)
        )

This table stores information about Famous fitnessers who have fame in this area of sports, Who have respect in Peoples eyes in the field of fitness.

*FAMID* 		Famous Fitnessers Id 
*FNAME* 		Famous Fitnessers Name
*RECORDNO* 		Famous Fitnessers Record No if he or she won a world record.


*FAMID* Famous Fitnessers Id is the primary key for this table.
*RECORDNO* Refrences the Fitnessers Record table to show if a famous fitnesser won a record or not.


Tables General (Refrenctial Integrity):
****************************************

.. code-block:: plpgsql

	@app.route('/initdatabase')
	def initialize_database():
    	with dbapi2.connect(app.config['dsn']) as connection:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        
        
        query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS DIETT CASCADE"""
        cursor.execute(query)
        
        query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS FITNESSTYPES CASCADE"""
        cursor.execute(query)
        
        query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS FAMFITNESSERS CASCADE"""
        cursor.execute(query)
        
        query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS FITNESSMD CASCADE"""
        cursor.execute(query)
        
        query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS FITNESSRECORDS CASCADE"""
        cursor.execute(query)

Since we need to keep data safe for refrential integrity, I have put Cascade for tables, to keep data it exits in one table and deleted on another table.
